License

Tribial Feminista is “Free and Open Source software” (F/OSS) and licensed under the “European Union Public Licence” (EUPL).

Here are some quick facts for a first glance to make the license easier to understand:

* You receive a series of world-wide, permanent, royalty-free, and non-exclusive rights. This means, for example, you can use XXXXX in Europe and outside of Europe, and the rights are given forever.
* You can use Tribial Feminista in any circumstance and for all usage. This means, for example, that both private and public uses, non-profit or for-profit uses are allowed. Your program distributed along with it is not restricted to be open-source software. You can use XXXXXX within a single application using static or dynamic linking, but without merging the source codes.
* If you make modifications and decide to re-distribute the derivative work, the forked derivative must be under the EUPL. If you incorporate pieces of software code licensed under a “permissive“ license (e.g. MIT or BSD), you re-distribute the combined derivative under the provision of the EUPL. If you incorporate pieces of software code licensed under a “copyleft“ license (e.g. GPL or EPL), you re-redistribute the combined derivative under the provision of the “copyleft“ license.
